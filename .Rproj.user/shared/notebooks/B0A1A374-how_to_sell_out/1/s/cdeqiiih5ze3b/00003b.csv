"0",""
"0","# First because we have different ranges, we'll need to specify each in a dataframe of their own."
"0","# Determined from aproximate min/max in training set: duration, release_year, us_popularity_estimate, key, loudness (backed up by research), mechanism, organism (those 2 were not listed in Spotify docs I found at all), energy flatness, time_signature"
"0","# Note acoustiness, energy max, instrumentalness in dataset were 9.9... but docs indicate each is a 0.0 to 1.0 scale aligned with other columns; I'll test both for chart effectiveness (likely a data anomoly/error(s) exist outside above 1.0)."
"0","# Switched the erroneous 0 to 10 ranges to the 0 to 1 listed in docs because test proved that none in our dataset appeared away from the center of radar chart at 0. Once I disabled scientific notation, instrumentalness dropped values down below 1.0 in our dataset."
"0","# Dynamic range also is accounted for as part of energy calculation so if its range is ineffective visually with the others, we could omit that column as its own variable as somewhat redundant."
"0","# Updated to remove: dyn_range_mean = c(35.0, 0.0)."
"0","# Loudness in max aggregation shows -60 as the max, but as a natural scale I flipped min to that negative end of range whereas 0 became the max (and 0 was min in R aggregate function calculation)."
"0","# However, after testing, I switched loudness back to max as -60 because this allowed the center of radar range point to be 0 for all except the year, which makes for a more congruent view across variables with different range end points."
