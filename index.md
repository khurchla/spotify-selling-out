# Sell Out Music Listener
An academic project to build an app for a musician to learn things about music that they can jump off of to become a pop star. 

_Seriously, though, be yourself. Make music that moves you. This is for fun and learning._

## What does popular music _look_ like?

This project aims to visualize Spotify data to _see_ just that, what features might be common among popular music in very different genres?

## What does popular music _sound_ like?

More essentially for our intended musician audience, and perhaps less uniquely a representation of music, secondary aim is to **sonify** popular music--Spotify audio tracks--to _hear_ the same commonalities among popular music.

### Contact or Contribute

[Probably email me](mailto:kmhurchla@gmail.com) and say hi. I can add folks as contributors to the repository, and hey I'm curious what's one post-it note on your desk you can tell me about? (This is about you, with no necessity to be related to this project, like take my idiosyncracies for example, below).

I've got posted beside my computer:
"Correlation is valued between -1 > 0 > 1 (Zero is no correlation.)" _Seriously, I love|hate statistics._

And: "Option + Shift + K"

Also: "MAGI" and "LTV" and some other financial stats I constantly have to remember what exactly each stands for and why I should care...

There's also a matchbox car.
